# 🟥 Python Practice: HARD Question Set 1

This set contains 10 *hard-level* hands-on Python challenges based on *Chapter 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff*. These tasks combine multiple core concepts including user input, data types, string operations, formatting, replication, variables, and print() statements — all while staying within beginner-friendly syntax.

Each script (from q1.py to q10.py) solves a realistic mini problem using only what you've learned from Python basics.
