# üêç Python Basics ‚Äì Easy Questions Set 2 (q16.py ‚Äì q30.py)

This folder contains beginner-level Python exercises (q16.py to q30.py) focused on variables, input/output, basic operations, type conversion, and simple expressions. It's a continuation of foundational practice to solidify Python basics before progressing to more advanced topics.

## üìÇ File List and Descriptions

Each file solves a specific beginner Python problem:

File	Description
q16.py	Store your name and age in variables and print them in a sentence.
q17.py	Print a blank line using print().
q18.py	Ask the user for a number, convert it to int, and double it.
q19.py	Try entering invalid syntax (5 +) and observe the error.
q20.py	Ask for a name and print the number of letters using len().
q21.py	Subtract two numbers, store the result in a variable, and print it.
q22.py	Ask the user for their hobby and print a compliment.
q23.py	Combine input(), str(), and + to build and print a full sentence.
q24.py	Ask for a decimal number, convert to float, and add 10.
q25.py	Print the data type of "hello" using type().
q26.py	Create first_name and last_name variables, and print a greeting.
q27.py	Convert the string "42" to an integer and print its type.
q28.py	Calculate and print the area of a rectangle (length * width).
q29.py	Use the interactive shell to check the type of 3.14 and "True".
q30.py	Ask for two numbers as strings and print their concatenation (no math).

## ‚ñ∂ How to Run
