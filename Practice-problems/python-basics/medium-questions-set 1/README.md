🟡 Python Basics: Medium Questions – Set 1

This repository contains a set of 13 medium-difficulty Python exercises (q1.py to q13.py) designed to help learners strengthen their understanding of variables, user input, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and basic logic flow. These tasks build on foundational knowledge and start introducing small problem-solving patterns.
