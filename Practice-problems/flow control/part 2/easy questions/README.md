Write a program that asks the user for an integer. If the number is even, print "Even number"; otherwise, print "Odd number".

---

### q4.py
*Name Greeting*

---

### q6.py
*Larger Number*  
Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. If the first number is larger than the second, print "The larger number is X" where X is the first number; otherwise, print "The larger number is Y" where Y is the second number.

---

### q7.py
*Word Repetition*  
Write a program that asks the user for a word. If the word is "Python", print the word three times; otherwise, print the word twice separated by a space. (Use string concatenation and replication.)

---

### q8.py
*Sentence Length*  
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence. If the sentence has more than 20 characters, print "Long sentence"; otherwise, print "Short sentence".

---

### q9.py
*Divisible by Five*  
Write a program that asks the user for a number. If the number is divisible by 5, print "High five!"; otherwise, print the number itself.

---

### q10.py
*String Equality*  
Write a program that asks the user to enter two strings. If the strings are the same, print "Same strings"; otherwise, print "Different strings".

---

### q11.py
*Check Equality*  
Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. If the numbers are equal, print "Equal"; otherwise, print "Not equal".

---

### q12.py
*Greater Number in Range (Inclusive)*  
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. If the number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive), print "True"; otherwise, print "False".

---

### q13.py
*Empty String Check*  
Write a program that asks the user to type something. If the user doesn't type anything (empty string), print "You didn’t type anything!"; otherwise, print "Thank you for typing!".

💡 Tips for Practice

Test your code with different inputs to observe how the condition behaves.

Use .lower() or .strip() on strings for better comparison if needed.

Keep comments in your code explaining what each if block is doing.
