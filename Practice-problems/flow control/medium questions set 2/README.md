🗂 Full Question Set

q11.py

Ask the user for their current age (as an integer) and whether they have a driver's license (as a Boolean, True or False). Print whether they are both 18 years or older AND have a driver's license.

q12.py

Ask for two numbers. Store them as a and b. Print whether a is less than b OR a is equal to b.

q13.py

Ask the user for a password string. Print whether the length of the password is greater than 8 AND the password is not equal to "password123".

q14.py

Create two Boolean variables: has_coupon = True and is_member = False. Print the result of not has_coupon AND is_member.

q15.py

Ask for a temperature in Celsius (float). Print whether the temperature is less than 0.0 OR greater than 30.0.

q16.py

Ask for two integers, num_apples and num_oranges. Print whether num_apples is greater than or equal to 10 AND num_oranges is less than 5.

q17.py

Ask the user to enter their name and a single character. Print whether the not of (the length of their name is less than 5) OR (the entered character is equal to 'X').

q18.py

Assign a string variable message = "Python is fun". Print whether not (len(message) == 13) AND (message == "Python is fun").

q19.py

Ask the user for a whole number. Print whether the number is less than 100 AND not (the number is less than 50).

q20.py

Ask for two numbers (integers). Print whether the first number is equal to the second number OR the sum of the two numbers is greater than 20.
