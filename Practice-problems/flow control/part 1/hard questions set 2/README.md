🔺 Hard Questions – Set 2 (q6.py to q10.py)

This set of Python practice questions focuses on complex Boolean logic, multi-variable condition checks, and combining user input types (strings, integers, floats). These are excellent for building deep logical reasoning skills without using if statements or functions.

📄 Questions (Exact)

🔢 Total: 5 Questions
📁 Files: q6.py to q10.py


---

✅ Q6 (q6.py)

> Ask the user to input three different words. Print whether the length of the first word is greater than the length of the second word AND the second word is not equal to the third word OR the first word is equal to the third word.




---

✅ Q7 (q7.py)

> Ask for an integer year. Print True if it's a leap year, False otherwise.
(A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is divisible by 100 but not by 400. Use % for divisibility check, e.g., year % 4 == 0).




---

✅ Q8 (q8.py)

> Ask for three numbers: temp_celsius (float), humidity (integer), and wind_speed (float).
Print True if the weather is "pleasant", defined as:
temp_celsius is between 15 and 25 (inclusive) AND humidity is less than 70 AND not (wind_speed is greater than 20).




---

✅ Q9 (q9.py)

> Ask for a color (str) and two numbers (int).
Print True if the color is "blue" AND not (the first number is equal to the second number) OR the sum of the two numbers is less than 10.




---

✅ Q10 (q10.py)

> Ask the user for a secret code (a string) and a security level (an integer).
Print True if the security check passes, defined as:
not (the secret code is "admin") AND the length of the secret code is greater than 7 AND the security level is greater than or equal to 5
OR the security level is equal to 10.

💡 Concepts Covered

Compound Boolean expressions (and, or, not)

Multiple data types (str, int, float)

String length and equality checks

Chained comparison and operator precedence

Practical condition design (e.g., leap years, security logic, weather analysis)

🛠 How to Run

Each file is standalone. Run them from your terminal like so:

python q6.py

Repeat with q7.py through q10.py.
