🧠 Medium Python Practice – Boolean Logic & Comparisons (q1.py to q10.py)

This folder contains 10 medium-level Python practice questions that focus on Boolean expressions, logical operators, and comparisons.
These continue directly from the foundational skills in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (Chapter 2).

> ❌ No if, else, loops, or functions are used — we’re still building core logic fluency.

📂 Full Questions (q1.py – q10.py)

File	Full Question

q1.py	Ask the user to enter a number and print whether it is between 10 and 20 (inclusive).
q2.py	Ask the user for two numbers and print whether both are equal.
q3.py	Use the and operator to evaluate whether the number 7 is less than 10 and greater than 3.
q4.py	Ask the user to input a word and print whether its length is greater than 5.
q5.py	Ask the user for two numbers and print whether at least one of them is greater than 100.
q6.py	Ask the user to enter a number, then check whether the number is not less than 0.
q7.py	Ask for two strings and check whether both have the same number of characters.
q8.py	Ask for a username and password, and check whether both match "user1" and "pass1" exactly.
q9.py	Check the result of this expression and print it: not (True and False)
q10.py	Ask the user to enter a number and print True if the number is even or greater than 50.

📘 Reference

These exercises are derived from Chapter 2: Flow Control of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart.
They help you build confidence in constructing and evaluating Boolean expressions before moving into control flow (like if statements).
