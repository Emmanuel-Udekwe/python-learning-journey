ðŸ§  Easy Python Practice Set (q11.py â€“ q20.py)

This set contains 10 beginner-level hands-on Python practice questions based on:

âœ… Chapter 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
âœ… The early part of Chapter 2 (up to Boolean values and logical operators only)

These exercises reinforce:

ðŸ“Œ Variables and data types
ðŸ“Œ input() / print()
ðŸ“Œ Type casting (int(), float(), str())
ðŸ“Œ len() and type()
ðŸ“Œ Boolean values (True, False)
ðŸ“Œ Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
ðŸ“Œ Logical operators (and, or, not)

> ðŸ›‘ No if, else, loops, or functions used â€” these questions respect the current learning scope.

ðŸ“‚ Full Questions (q11.py â€“ q20.py)

File	Full Question

q11.py	Store your first name in a string variable and your age as an integer variable. Print a sentence combining them, like: "My name is [Name] and I am [Age] years old."
q12.py	Ask the user to input two whole numbers. Store them in variables num1 and num2. Print whether num1 is greater than num2 (the output should be True or False).
q13.py	Create a variable is_sunny and assign it the Boolean value True. Print a message that includes the value of is_sunny.
q14.py	Ask the user for their favorite animal. Store it in a variable. Print the total number of characters in the animal's name.
q15.py	Assign the integer 25 to a variable x and the float 25.0 to a variable y. Print whether x is equal to y.
q16.py	Ask the user for two words. Print whether the first word is not equal to the second word.
q17.py	Store the value False in a variable named is_raining. Print the result of applying the not operator to is_raining.
q18.py	Ask for a user's height in centimeters (as a string). Convert it to an integer and print a statement like: "Your height is [height] cm."
q19.py	Print the result of the comparison: (100 >= 99).
q20.py	Ask for the price of an item (e.g., "5.99"). Convert it to a float and print its data type using type().

âœ… Sample Topics Covered

String concatenation: "My name is " + name

Boolean comparison: num1 > num2, x == y

Logical negation: not is_raining

User input processing: int(input(...)), float(input(...))

Useful built-in functions: len(), type()
